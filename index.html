  <div class="col-sm-8"><p>2020 will be remembered for generations to come as a momentous year for modern civilisation.  It will also be remembered by private forestry owners as a year which poor forward planning by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) Forestry Section led to a virtual halt to all licences for any forest activity.  This was a result of a huge anti-forestry campaign by individuals/groups with other agendas rather than environmental concerns, which was the basis for objectors.</p></div>

  <div class="col-sm-9"><p>The new Minister from the Green party, <a href="https://www.greenparty.ie/people/pippa-hackett/">Pippa Hackett,</a> has altered the objection criteria, but the damage has already been done with forestry now losing its allure for private landowners.</p>

  <p>Your Group, the North East Forestry Group (NEFG) has taken on board members concerns and has repeatedly made representations to the DAFM for a solution to this crisis.  This has resulted in the formation of an umbrella group being formed of all the 13 private forest owner groups in Ireland.  We will now, hopefully, have influence at the highest level and be involved in all changes/proposals with regard to policy and funding for what is essentially our land and crops, which all other parts of the timber industry rely on for their business.  We will be launching this group in the near future.</p></div>

<div class ="col-sm-12">
<p>Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, the NEFG has had to postpone a number of proposed initiatives, which were planned for this year.  We did, however, have a field day at Stephen Clarke’s forest in Kells (limited to 15 members) in which Kevin O’Connell from Teagasc explained the criteria required to access the new Ash dieback treatment scheme.  This was very informative, but showed how difficult it was to identify the 10% lesions required to avail of the clear fell grant.  Subsequent to this, a number of members have applied for this grant using a Forester (Manus Crowley) who is doing other work for group members.</p>

<p>The 12 members of your Group who are FSC certified, also passed their annual audit and have maintained their group certificate.  We are hoping to open this to members next year, when we can meet in a more relaxed manner post Covid 19.</p>

<p>Four Group members now have succeeded into getting funding for a continuous cover initiative by the DAFM.  They have appointed Manus Crowley, who is a continuous cover specialist, to oversee this project</p>

  <div class="col-sm-8"><p>Two members of your Group won awards in the RDS Forestry Awards.  Peter Farrelly (shown on the left here) from Kilmainham Wood, won the Forestry Production Award, with myself, John Sherlock (shown to the right here) from Navan as the runner up.We urge you to enter this competition, as there is a significant prize fund, and of course, it was an honour to be considered.</p></div>
