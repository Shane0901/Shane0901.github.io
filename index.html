  <div class="col-sm-8"><p>2020 will be remembered for generations to come as a momentous year for modern civilisation.  It will also be remembered by private forestry owners as a year which poor forward planning by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) Forestry Section led to a virtual halt to all licences for any forest activity.  This was a result of a huge anti-forestry campaign by individuals/groups with other agendas rather than environmental concerns, which was the basis for objectors.</p></div>

  <div class="col-sm-8"><p>The new Minister from the Green party, Pippa Hackett, has altered the objection criteria, but the damage has already been done with forestry now losing its allure for private landowners.</p>
<br>
<p>Your Group, the North East Forestry Group (NEFG) has taken on board members concerns and has repeatedly made representations to the DAFM for a solution to this crisis.  This has resulted in the formation of an umbrella group being formed of all the 13 private forest owner groups in Ireland.  We will now, hopefully, have influence at the highest level and be involved in all changes/proposals with regard to policy and funding for what is essentially our land and crops, which all other parts of the timber industry rely on for their business.  We will be launching this group in the near future.</p></div>
